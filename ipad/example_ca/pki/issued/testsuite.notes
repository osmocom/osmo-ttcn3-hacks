This certificate is suitable for tests where the testsuite runs on a separate
machine or VM that has the hostname "testsuite"

The testsuite.crt certificate has been created using the following commandline:
./easyrsa --subject-alt-name="DNS:testsuite" build-server-full testsuite nopass

The testsuite.cabundle file has been created manually (alttest certificate at the
top, ca certificate at the bottom).
