This certificate is suitable for tests on any machine where testsuite and IPAd
run on the same host.

The alttest.crt certificate has been created using the following commandline:
./easyrsa --subject-alt-name="DNS:localhost,IP:127.0.0.1" build-server-full alttest nopass

The alttest.cabundle file has been created manually (alttest certificate at the
top, ca certificate at the bottom).
