Osmocom TTCN-3 Test Suites
==========================

This repository contains a collection of test suites developed within
the [Osmocom](https://osmocom.org/) (Open Source Mobile Communications)
project.  The test suites are developed in the
[TTCN-3](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/TTCN-3) programming language,
compiled/executed by the [Eclipse TITAN](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.titan)
compiler and runtime.

Those test suites mostly are performing *functional testing* of cellular
network elements, from 2G, 3G, 4G to 5G.  The individual test-suites are
in sub-directories, while some shared library code is in *library*.


Continuous Integration
----------------------

The individual tests suites are executed against different versions of
the respective IUT (Implementation Under Test) by the Osmocom jenkins.

See the [list of all TTCN-3 jenkins jobs](https://jenkins.osmocom.org/jenkins/view/TTCN3/)
for more details
